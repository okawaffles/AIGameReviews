# Roblox

Roblox is a game about building. You can use blocks to build anything you want, from simple structures like houses and trees to more complex things like roller coasters or roller skating arenas. Or you can just make something funny, like a giant block of cheese that you can run around in, jumping on it while screaming "Mmmmm!"

I have built a lot of things over the years. I've made a bridge so you could cross a river without getting wet, and a pool where you can dive into an enormous block of ice. I've created a treehouse with a swing, and a haunted house outfitted with all kinds of spooky sounds and lights. But until now, I'd never been able to create what I really wanted to: a place for me and my friends to hang out together. So I decided to try making one myself.

But first, I needed some help. Fortunately, there are lots of other people who play Roblox as well. And since those other people are called "players," I figured it would be pretty easy to find them and ask if they were interested in helping me make this thing I had in mind.

So that's what I did. I put up a sign outside my house inviting players to come inside and check out my new project, which was still just a big empty room. Then I started broadcasting my own stream on Twitch, so everyone else could see how far along I'd gotten with the construction. It didn't take long before people started coming byâ€”a bunch of them at once, actually.

"Oh wow! Look at this place!" one of the players said when she arrived. She ran over to inspect my work, but not too closely. When she saw the giant block of cheese, her eyes got very wide. I laughed and waved, then explained what I was doing. I showed them the map and the plan I'd drawn up, explaining that I wanted to make a large outdoor area where we could hang out together and play games.

And play games we did. We played a couple rounds of hide-and-seek (which I won), and two rounds of tag (which I lost). Then, after a few minutes, we all agreed that enough was enough. Time to go back home and get ready for bed.

A little while later, I went to sleep myself, dreaming about what my dream building might look like someday. It would definitely have a pool, and maybe even a small roller coaster. There would be plenty of places for us to hang out, including a kitchen, a living room, and a gym. Oh, and a giant block of cheese. For sure.

In the morning, I woke up to find a lot of messages waiting for me. Most of them simply congratulated me on creating the coolest place ever. Some of them asked when I planned to open it to the public. And some of them told me I should come hang out with them instead.

The next day, I opened my house to the public. I let everybody through the front door, and watched as they explored every nook and cranny, climbing on top of the tables and chairs, and hanging upside down from the ceiling. They sat at the bar and ate pizza, and took turns rolling the big wheel in the middle of my floor. They played hide-and-seek again, and rode my roller coaster, and jumped off the roof. And they kept doing all those things, over and over again.

For the rest of that week, I spent most of my time inside my house, playing with my friends. Sometimes I'd join them in their adventures, helping to hunt monsters and defeat bosses. Other times, it was nice to just watch from the sidelines. It felt kind of strange, watching everything unfold in real time, but I liked it. Maybe because I knew that no matter how many people came or left, this place would always be mine.
