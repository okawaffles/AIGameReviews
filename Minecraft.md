# Minecraft

Minecraft is a game about placing blocks. It's simple, right? I mean that in the best way possible â€“ it's one of the most accessible games ever made. If you've played Super Mario Bros. or Tetris then you know how to play Minecraft. But there are so many things going on under the surface, and even more ways to play the game than just jumping around. As I wrote last year when I recommended some of my favorite mods for the game, "If you're only playing vanilla Minecraft without any mods, you're missing out." The same thing applies here: There are so many different kinds of mods. Here are a few that can help make your experience with Minecraft even better.

The first set of mods all involve helping your character survive longer in the world. Some of these will add new mobs or monsters that might give you trouble, while others will change the terrain around you so you have a chance of walking away from a fight.

First up is an oddball mod that adds some sort of goo to the game. This stuff looks like translucent green slime, but it doesn't really do anything except clog up pipes and block doors. It also has a tendency to break apart into little balls if you walk through it. That's not very useful, but this is a survival game after all, so finding ways to stay alive is important. One of the best ways to get around is to find a long tunnel, drop down, and use a pressure plate as a trigger to open a door at the other end. The problem is that if you're standing on top of the slime, you'll fall through the floor and die. This makes the goo pretty useless, but it's still fun to watch people try to walk across it and then fall through. And there's something kind of cool about seeing someone stand on a pressure plate, press the button, and suddenly be covered in slime.

That's just one of the strange effects of the "Green Goo" mod, though. There are several different types of this stuff scattered throughout the world, including some that glow and some that don't, and you can buy and sell the various variants to make money. The player who created this mod doesn't seem to update it anymore, but there are plenty of alternatives. A good place to start would be the Green Goo Wiki, which lists dozens of different versions and provides information on where to find them. It also includes a list of "strange items" that you can find by combining multiple types, such as "Green Goop + Green Fluid" or "Blue Goo + Blue Fluid". You can find a lot of these items in creative mode, too.

Another popular survival mod is "HiveMind", which makes the creatures in the game smarter. Now, they still won't be able to plan anything complex (like building a house), but they should be more likely to react to threats and even attack you when you show signs of aggression. They also now have a bit of intelligence when it comes to hunting and gathering food. Most of the time, they'll avoid getting eaten by predators, but sometimes they'll actually follow the monster that killed their prey instead of running away. There are other options for making the monsters more intelligent, too. For example, there's the "Survival Perks" mod, which adds perks like "Smart" or "Stealthy" to the default mob types. These changes can dramatically alter the way you approach each map.

There are several mods that add new types of mobs to the game, and some of them can be really dangerous. For instance, there's "DoomHammer", which gives players a much higher chance of being attacked by giant spiders. In addition to being huge and aggressive, these spiders are also quite powerful, capable of taking down a human in a single hit. The mod also adds some new spider-specific weapons, like the "Spider Trap" and "Spider Glide". Another mod, "Necromancer", adds a whole new pack of zombies to the game. These guys are tough, and they have a wide variety of attacks. Some of the more interesting ones include "Berserk", which causes them to randomly switch targets between nearby players, "Kamikaze", which lets them fly off a cliff and explode, and "Death Breath", which makes them spit out poison.

These aren't the only mods that add new monsters and enemies to the game. I haven't tried every single one, but this page on the official site has a complete list of mods that alter the core game in some way. It includes both free and paid mods, so check it out before downloading anything.
