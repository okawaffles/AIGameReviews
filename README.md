# AI generates game reviews

I use NovelAI to create "articles" about games, usually starting with the prompt: `<game> is a game about` and letting the AI finish.

Usually, they don't come out close to their actual game, but in some cases (like NekoparaSeries.md) the AI actually gets some aspects of the game correct.
